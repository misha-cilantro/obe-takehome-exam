# README

This is a simple API that allows searching for Rick & Morty characters by name and seeing how many times they appeared per season.
It uses the Rick & Morty API [https://rickandmortyapi.com/] and the rickmorty gem.

Search data is cached once per day.

Call API like: `/api/v1/character?name=rick`. 

The name parameter is required. All other parameters are ignored. If no character is found, an empty array is returned.

* Ruby version
Ruby 3.2.2

* System dependencies
This uses barebones Rails 7. The only additional gem is `rickmorty`, so it should be pretty straightforward to set up.
Note this app was generated with `--api` so there is no view rendering.
